STEPS:
1. Download any .py (Latest version recommended) file and store it in separate folder.
2. Change the path (line number 1) to your working directory
3. Run the python file 


Working:

1. Once you start solving the problem add link in text box (make you sure you have atleast single "/"(slash)) and after that select the problem rating and then press click me.
2. Then you can start the counter (By pressing start) and once done just press done, you will get "ADDED!" as message. (if you get "NOT VALID LINK" just add a "/"(slash) at the end of link).
3. You can get all your data in .csv files created in working directory with the name as problem rating.
4. If you press delete you can delete the last entry of selected file (if you mistakenly deleted an entry you can get it back from _backup.csv files). 


UPDATE:

If drop down menu is not working properly then hold the click and then select the rating.
